title: '1.2. Installation'
---

NIS can be installed either via installer using the [NEM Infrastructure Server](http://bob.nem.ninja/installer/) or as stand-alone package which is hosted on [http://bob.nem.ninja/](http://bob.nem.ninja/). The installer only supports 64 bit versions of Java. The current stand-alone version as of this writing is [nis-ncc-0.6.84.tgz](http://bob.nem.ninja/nis-ncc-0.6.84.tgz). When using the installer both installation and the start-up of the software is automatic. The stand-alone version needs to be unzipped to a directory of your choice. It is then started by running runNis.bat (windows) or nix.runNis.sh (linux) from the command prompt.
