| API path:    | Request type:   |
|--------------|:----------------|
| `/status`    | `GET`           |

##### Description:
Determines the status of NIS.

##### No Parameter
##### Example:
```
http://127.0.0.1:7890/status
```
##### Example of returned JSON object:
```json
{
    "code": 6,
    "type": 4,
    "message": "status"
}
```

The code can be interpreted as follows:
* 0: Unknown status.
* 1: NIS is stopped.
* 2: NIS is starting.
* 3: NIS is running.
* 4: NIS is booting the local node (implies NIS is running).
* 5: The local node is booted (implies NIS is running).
* 6: The local node is synchronized (implies NIS is running and the local node is booted).
* 7: NIS local node does not see any remote NIS node (implies running and booted).
* 8: NIS is currently loading the block chain from the database. In this state NIS cannot serve any requests.

##### Possible Errors:
If there is no response to this request, NIS is either not running or is in a state where it can't serve requests.
