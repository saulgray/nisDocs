# NIS status related requests

There are two requests by which you can get information about the status of NIS. The `/heartbeat` request gives you information if the node is up and responsive. The `/status` request gives more detailed information about the state of NIS. Both requests return a NemRequestResult object. *See Appendix A:* [NemRequestResult]() for more details on the interpretation of a NemRequestResult.
